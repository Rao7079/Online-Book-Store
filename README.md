# Online-Book-Store
Excited to share that I recently wrapped up a hands-on SQL project focused on managing and analyzing data for an Online Book Store. From writing basic queries to digging into advanced analytics, this project helped sharpen my data handling and problem-solving skills. 💡

🔍 Key Highlights:

Worked with CSV data for Books, Customers, and Orders.

Applied various SQL concepts: JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, subqueries, aggregation functions, and more.

Analyzed sales trends, customer behavior, stock tracking, and revenue generation.
